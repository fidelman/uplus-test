      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    Definitely, it is a joke. The task does not describe the browser compatibility,
    so I consider, all modern browsers should support the App, but IE is not the modern one.
    Anyway, CSS Grid Layout v2 will never be supported in IE, does it mean CSS Grid Layout 2 gets useless?
    Thank you for understanding
